            Acetic acid pron.: /əˈsiːtɨk/ (systematically named ethanoic acid pron.: /ˌɛθəˈnoʊɨk/) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH3CO2H (also written as CH3COOH or C2H4O2). It is a colourless liquid that when undiluted is also called glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar (apart from water; vinegar is roughly 8% acetic acid by volume), and has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. Besides its production as household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinylacetate and cellulose acetate. Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and attacks the skin.
